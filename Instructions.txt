Steps to run the codes:

1. For A5_2017171_Q1.py

-> Type python "filename"
-> Enter the path to the dataset (preferably should be in the same directory)
-> Then simply follow the commands that comes in the output of the command line
-> At "What do you want" question type either "Decision Tree" or "Bagged Decision Tree" or "Random Forest" (mind the capital first alphabet)
-> Then type either "Classification" or "Regression"
-> The enter the max_depth integer 
-> if Bagged Decision Tree option was selected then enter the number of bagged trees and no. of samples for one bag.
-> If Random Forest was selected then enter the no. of predictors in the How many random features question.
-> Based on what you selected (either "Classification" or "Regression"): Result should come up 
-> If Classification was selected then accuracy should be the result and if Regression was selected then mean sq. error, mean error and standard deviation of the error should be the output.

A Sample procedure of giving the inputs correctly and recieving the outputs correctly in the command line should be like this

"Enter the input path: dataset.csv
